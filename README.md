<li><h4>Symmetric Difference</h4><details><summary>Definition</summary><blockquote>The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that belong to one of the sets but not to both. It represents the elements that are exclusive to each set and can be computed as the union of the elements in one set and the complement of the intersection of both sets. <br><br>The code takes a variable number of sets of a variable number of values and makes the symmetric difference of all of them.</blockquote></details></li>
