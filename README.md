<li><h4>Symmetric Difference</h4><details><summary>Definition</summary><blockquote>
The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that belong to one of the sets but not to both. 
It represents the elements that are exclusive to each set and can be computed as the union of the elements in one set and the complement of the intersection of both sets. 
<br><br>The code takes a variable number of sets of a variable number of values and makes the symmetric difference of all of them.</blockquote></details>

<li><h4>Inventory Update</h4><details><summary>Definition</summary><blockquote>
Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array of items against a second 2D array of items of a fresh delivery. 
Updates the current existing inventory item quantities. 
If an item cannot be found, it adds the new item and quantity into the inventory array. 
The returned inventory array is sorted in alphabetical order by each item's name.</blockquote></details>

<li><h4>100 Doors</h4><details><summary>Definition</summary><blockquote>
There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed. You make 100 passes by the doors.
The first time through, visit every door and 'toggle' the door (if the door is closed, open it;
if it is open, close it). The second time, only visit every 2nd door (i.e., door #2, #4, #6, ...) and toggle it.
The third time, visit every 3rd door (i.e., door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc., until you only visit the 100th door.
<br><br>The function determines the state of the doors after the last pass and prints each opened doors number</blockquote></details>
